> browser application to visualize all of published versions of an application through ipscend. ipscend-screenshot-visualizer is deployed with ipscend! how neat is that :)

### Usage

This feature should be used through the [`ipscend`](https://github.com/diasdavid/ipscend) cli tool.

### Development

Use ipscend to try this tool with `ipscend preview`. There is a default hash used for dev purposes that has the versions from https://github.com/diasdavid/ipscend-example.

**NOTE:** Each time a new released is published, the hash of that version must be 'pinned' to IPFS and updated on the ipscend tool
